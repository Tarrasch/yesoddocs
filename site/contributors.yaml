  bio: Greg is a freelance web developer used to using Ruby for its expressiveness. He was looking for something faster, easier to scale, and with more intrinsic safety instead of requiring enormous amounts of unit tests. Yesod has been up to the challenge without throwing away the expressiveness he is used to. He used Yesod for eatnutrients.com and now spends time working with a startup using Yesod.
